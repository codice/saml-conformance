# SAML Conformance Test Kit
This project is intended to be a set of blackbox tests that verify the conformance of an IdP/SP to the SAML Spec.
It is currently a prototype being actively developed.

## idp
This module will contain all tests being written against a SAML IdP. 
Currently just has sub-directories for Web SSO and Single Logout, but that list will grow.

Current state: Two tests for Web SSO (post and redirect). 
Tests will be written against the IdP on DDF master for now.

## security-common
This module contains an assortment of Java classes that have been copied over from DDF to support parsing SAML metadata for the tests.

## ddf-plugins
This module contains the ServiceProvider plugins that are used to connect with
a DDF IdP. It should also be used as the model for building plugins for connecting
with other IdPs for compliance testing. The generated jar file from this module
needs to be installed to a deployment directory of the user's choosing and then
referred to by system property when running tests.

e.g. If the ServiceProvider plugin jar(s) are copied to `/home/saml-conform/deploy`
then the tests should be invoked with `-Dsaml.plugin.deployDir=/home/saml-conform/deploy`.

## docker
This modules is builds a docker image. To run this module add `-P docker` to the maven command.
To run it, run `docker run --rm -it -v <IDP_METADATA_PATH>:/samlconf/conf/idp-metadata.xml --add-host "<HOST_NAME>:<IP>" codice/samlconf`

where 

`<IDP_METADATA_PATH>` is the path to the file containing the idp's metadata (anywhere on your local machine ex: `/tmp/idp.xml`)

`<HOST_NAME>` is the hostname the IdP is running on (for DDF, DDF's hostname)

`<IP>` is the machine's IP address

To run the tests using the `docker-compose.yml` file run `docker-compose up` in the `/docker` module

>NOTE
>
>If building throws a `Connect to localhost:2375 [localhost/127.0.0.1, localhost/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1] failed: Connection refused`
error, go into docker settings &rarr; general &rarr; enable “Expose daemon to tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS”.

# Setup
The `distribution` module contains a full package of the deployment after a full build.
Tests can be run with the script `distribution/target/distribution-\[VERSION\]-bin/bin/samltest.sh`.

Inside your IDE, setting the vm environment variables `saml.plugin.deployDir`,
`idp.metadata`, and `sp.metadata` will allow you run unit tests.

If running against DDF, the simplest setup within your IDE would involve setting the
aforementioned variables thusly:

- `-Dsaml.plugin.deployDir=\[PATH_TO_PROJECT\]/distribution/target/distribution-\[VERSION\]-bin/plugins`
- `-Didp.metadata=\[PATH_TO_PROJECT\]/distribution/target/distribution-1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/conf/idp-metadata.xml`

Against other IdP implementations, the plugin and idp-metadata paths should be changed to reflect
the appropriate plugin implementation and metadata.

Finally:

- Start DDF master (or your IdP under test)
- Run the tests through your IDE or by invoking the `distribution/target/distribution-\[VERSION\]-bin/bin/samltest.sh`
script

#### To run against DDF
- Copy the contents of `test-sp-metadata` under `saml-conformance/distribution/src/main/resources` to `AdminConsole -> Security -> Configuration -> IdPServer -> SP Metadata`
- Copy DDF's metadata to `idp-metadata` under `saml-conformance/distribution/src/main/resources`

## TODO:
- Determine good directory structure (this will happen over time as we add more tests)
- Determine what inputs the test suite will need (thinking just giving it the IdP/SP metadata)
- Determine the combinations of SP's that we want to test with
  - DDF IdP/SP
  - Shibboleth SP and DDF IdP
  - Shibboleth IdP and DDF IdP
  - Spring SP and DDF IdP
