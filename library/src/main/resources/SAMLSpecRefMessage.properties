  <SubjectConfirmationData> element.

SAMLProfiles_3_1_b=An xsi:type attribute MAY be present in the <SubjectConfirmationData> element \
  and, if present, MUST be set to saml:KeyInfoConfirmationDataType (the namespace prefix is \
  arbitrary but must reference the SAML assertion namespace).

SAMLProfiles_3_1_c=Note that in accordance with [XMLSig], each <ds:KeyInfo> element MUST identify \
  a single cryptographic key. Multiple keys MAY be identified with separate <ds:KeyInfo> \
  elements, such as when different confirmation keys are needed for different relying parties.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_2_a=The HTTP Redirect binding MUST NOT be used, as the response will typically \
  exceed the URL length permitted by most user agents.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_1_a=If the identity provider cannot or will not satisfy the request, it \
  MUST respond with a <Response> message containing an appropriate error status code or codes.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_1_b=Note that the service provider MAY include a <Subject> element in the \
  request that names the actual identity about which it wishes to receive an assertion. This \
  element MUST NOT contain any <SubjectConfirmation> elements. If the identity provider does \
  not recognize the principal as that identity, then it MUST respond with a <Response> message \
  containing an error status and no assertions.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_a=If the <Response> message is signed or if an enclosed assertion is \
  encrypted, then the <Issuer> element MUST be present.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_b=If present [the Issuer] MUST contain the unique identifier of the issuing \
  identity provider.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_c=The Format attribute MUST be omitted or have a value of \
  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_d=[A Response] MUST contain at least one <Assertion>.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_e=If multiple assertions are included, then each assertion's <Subject> element \
 MUST refer to the same principal.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_g=Any assertion issued for consumption using this profile MUST contain a \
  <Subject> element with at least one <SubjectConfirmation> element containing a Method of \
  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_h=At lease one bearer <SubjectConfirmation> element MUST contain a \
  <SubjectConfirmationData> element that itself MUST: \n \
  - contain a Recipient attribute containing the service provider's assertion consumer service URL\
  - contain a NotOnOrAfter attribute that limits the window during which the assertion can be \n \
  confirmed by the relying party \n \
  - NOT contain a NotBefore attribute \n \
  - if the containing message is in response to an <AuthnRequest>, then the InResponseTo attribute \
  MUST match the request's ID.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_i=The set of one or more bearer assertions MUST contain at least one \
  <AuthnStatement> that reflects the authentication of the principal to the identity provider.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_j=If the identity provider supports the Single Logout profile, defined in \
  Section 4.4, any authentication statements MUST include a SessionIndex attribute to enable \
  per-session logout requests by the service provider.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_k=Each bearer assertion MUST contain an <AudienceRestriction> including the \
  service provider's unique identifier as an <Audience>.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_l=If the identity provider wishes to return an error, it MUST NOT include \
  any assertions in the <Response> message.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_5_a=If the HTTP POST binding is used to deliver the <Response>, [E26]each \
  assertion MUST be protected by a digital signature. This can be accomplished by signing each \
  individual <Assertion> element or by signing the <Response> element.

  character, and are REQUIRED to be absolute [RFC 2396].

SAMLCore_1_3_3_a=All SAML time values have the type xs:dateTime, which is built in to the W3C XML \
  Schema Datatypes specification [Schema2], and MUST be expressed in UTC form, with no time zone \
  component.

SAMLCore_1_3_4_a=Where a data object declares that it has a particular identifier, there MUST be \
  exactly one such declaration.

SAMLCore_2_2_3_a=An xsi:type attribute MUST be used to indicate the actual statement type.

SAMLCore_2_2_3_b=An assertion with no statements MUST contain a <Subject> element. Such an \
  assertion identifies a principal in a manner which can be referenced or confirmed using SAML \
  methods, but asserts no further information associated with that principal.

SAMLCore_2_2_4_a=The Type attribute [for an EncryptedData] SHOULD be present and, if present, MUST \
contain a value of http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#Element.

SAMLCore_2_3_3_a=The identifier for the version of SAML defined in this specification is '2.0'.

SAMLCore_2_5_1_a=An xsi:type attribute MUST be used [in the Condition element] to indicate the \
  actual condition type.

SAMLCore_2_5_1_b=There MUST be at most one instance of [the OneTimeUse] element [under Conditions].

SAMLCore_2_5_1_c=There MUST be at most one instance of [the ProxyRestriction] element [under \
  Conditions].

SAMLCore_2_5_1_2_a=If both attributes are present, the value for NotBefore MUST be less than \
  (earlier than) the value for NotOnOrAfter.

SAMLCore_2_5_1_5_a=A SAML authority MUST NOT include more than one <OneTimeUse> element within a \
  <Conditions> element of an assertion.

SAMLCore_2_5_1_6_a=Otherwise, any assertions so issued MUST themselves contain an \
  <AudienceRestriction> element with at least one of the <Audience> elements present in the \
  previous <ProxyRestriction> element, and no <Audience> elements present that were not in the \
  previous <ProxyRestriction> element.

SAMLCore_2_5_1_6_b=A SAML authority MUST NOT include more than one <ProxyRestriction> element \
  within a <Conditions> element of an assertion.

SAMLCore_2_7_2_a=Assertions containing <AuthnStatement> elements MUST contain a <Subject> element.

SAMLCore_2_7_3_2_a=The Type attribute [for an EncryptedData] SHOULD be present and, if present, \
  MUST contain a value of http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#Element.

SAMLCore_2_7_4_a=Assertions containing <AuthzDecisionStatement> elements MUST contain a <Subject> \
  element.

SAMLCore_3_2_1_a=An identifier for the request. It is of type xs:ID and MUST follow the \
  requirements specified in Section 1.3.4 for identifier uniqueness.

SAMLCore_3_2_1_b=The identifier for the version of SAML defined in this specification is '2.0'.

SAMLCore_3_2_1_c=The time value is encoded in UTC, as described in Section 1.3.3.

SAMLCore_3_2_1_d=If a SAML responder deems a request to be invalid according to SAML syntax or \
  processing rules, then if it responds, it MUST return a SAML response message with a \
  <StatusCode> element.

SAMLCore_3_2_1_e=If [Destination] is present, the actual recipient MUST check that the URI reference \
  identifies the location at which the message was received. If it does not, the request MUST be \
  discarded.

SAMLCore_3_2_2_a=It is of type xs:ID, and MUST follow the requirements specified in Section 1.3.4 \
  for identifier uniqueness.

SAMLCore_3_2_2_b=If the response is not generated in response to a request, or if the ID attribute \
  value of a request cannot be determined (for example, the request is malformed), then this \
  attribute MUST NOT be present. Otherwise, it MUST be present and its value MUST match the value \
  of the corresponding request's ID attribute.

SAMLCore_3_2_2_c=The identifier for the version of SAML defined in this specification is '2.0'.

SAMLCore_3_2_2_d=The time value is encoded in UTC, as described in Section 1.3.3.

SAMLCore_3_2_2_e=If it is present, the actual recipient MUST check that the URI reference \
  identifies the location at which the message was received. If it does not, the response MUST be \
  discarded. Some protocol bindings may require the use of this attribute (see [SAMLBind]).

SAMLCore_3_2_2_2_a=The value of the topmost <StatusCode> element MUST be from the top-level list \
  provided in this section.\nThe permissible top-level <StatusCode> values are as follows:\
  \n - urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success\
  \n - urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Requester\
  \n - urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder\
  \n - urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:VersionMismatch

SAMLCore_3_3_4_a=In response to a SAML-defined query message, every assertion returned by a SAML \
  authority MUST contain a <saml:Subject> element that strongly matches the <saml:Subject> element \
  found in the query.

SAMLCore_3_3_4_b=If S2 [request subject] includes an identifier element (<BaseID>, <NameID>, or \
  <EncryptedID>), then S1 [response subject] MUST include an identical identifier element, but the \
  element MAY be encrypted (or not) in either S1 [response subject] or S2 [request subject]. In \
  other words, the decrypted form of the identifier MUST be identical in S1 [response subject] and \
  S2 [request subject]. "Identical" means that the identifier element's content and attribute \
  values MUST be the same.

SAMLCore_3_3_4_c=If S2 [request subject] includes one or more <saml:SubjectConfirmation> elements, \
  then S1 [response subject] MUST include at least one <saml:SubjectConfirmation> element such that \
  S1 [response subject] can be confirmed in the manner described by at least one \
  <saml:SubjectConfirmation> element in S2 [request subject].

SAMLCore_3_4_a=When a principal (or an agent acting on the principal's behalf) wishes to obtain \
  assertions containing authentication statements to establish a security context at one or more \
  relying parties, it can use the authentication request protocol to send an <AuthnRequest> \
  message element to a SAML authority and request that it return a <Response> message containing \
  one or more such assertions. Such assertions MAY contain additional statements of any type, but \
  at least one assertion MUST contain at least one authentication statement. A SAML authority that \
  supports this protocol is also termed an identity provider.

# This isn't fully covered until we:
#  - Support Artifact binding and
#  - Write a new test to specify to use the Artifact endpoint with AssertionConsumerServiceURL and
#  - Write a new test to specify to use the Artifact endpoint with AssertionConsumerServiceIndex
SAMLCore_3_4_1_a=AssertionConsumerServiceIndex [Optional] \
  \nIndirectly identifies the location to which the <Response> message should be returned to the \
  requester. It applies only to profiles in which the requester is different from the presenter, \
  such as the Web Browser SSO profile in [SAMLProf]. The identity provider MUST have a trusted \
  means to map the index value in the attribute to a location associated with the requester. \
  [SAMLMeta] provides one possible mechanism. If omitted, then the identity provider MUST return \
  the <Response> message to the default location associated with the requester for the profile of \
  use. If the index specified is invalid, then the identity provider MAY return an error \
  <Response> or it MAY use the default location. This attribute is mutually exclusive with the \
  AssertionConsumerServiceURL and ProtocolBinding attributes. \
  \n\nAssertionConsumerServiceURL [Optional]\
  \nSpecifies by value the location to which the <Response> message MUST be returned to the \
  requester. The responder MUST ensure by some means that the value specified is in fact \
  associated with the requester. [SAMLMeta] provides one possible mechanism; signing the enclosing \
  <AuthnRequest> message is another. This attribute is mutually exclusive with the \
  AssertionConsumerServiceIndex attribute and is typically accompanied by the ProtocolBinding \
  attribute.

SAMLCore_3_4_1_1_a=The special Format value urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:encrypted \
  indicates that the resulting assertion(s) MUST contain <EncryptedID> elements instead of \
  plaintext.

SAMLCore_3_4_1_1_b=When a Format defined in Section 8.3 other than \
  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified or \
  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:encrypted is used, then if the identity provider \
  returns any assertions: the Format value of the <NameID> within the <Subject> of any <Assertion> \
  MUST be identical to the Format value supplied in the <NameIDPolicy> and if SPNameQualifier is \
  not omitted in <NameIDPolicy>, the SPNameQualifier value of the <NameID> within the <Subject> of \
  any <Assertion> MUST be identical to the SPNameQualifier value supplied in the <NameIDPolicy>.

SAMLCore_3_4_1_4_a=The responder MUST ultimately reply to an <AuthnRequest> with a <Response> \
  message containing one or more assertions that meet the specifications defined by the request

SAMLCore_3_4_1_4_b=If the <saml:Subject> element in the request is present, then the resulting \
  assertions' <saml:Subject> MUST strongly match the request <saml:Subject>, as described in \
  Section 3.3.4, except that the identifier MAY be in a different format if specified by \
  <NameIDPolicy>. In such a case, the identifier's physical content MAY be different, but it MUST \
  refer to the same principal.

SAMLCore_3_4_1_4_c=The assertion(s) returned MUST contain a <saml:Subject> element that represents \
  the presenter.

SAMLCore_3_4_1_4_d=At least one statement in at least one assertion MUST be a <saml:AuthnStatement> \
  that describes the authentication performed by the responder or authentication service \
  associated with it.

SAMLCore_3_4_1_4_e=The resulting assertion(s) MUST contain a <saml:AudienceRestriction> element \
  referencing the requester as an acceptable relying party.

SAMLCore_3_7_1_a=This specification further restricts the schema by requiring that the Reason \
  attribute MUST be in the form of a URI reference.

SAMLCore_3_7_3_2_a=When a session authority receives a <LogoutRequest> message, the session \
  authority MUST authenticate the sender.

SAMLCore_3_7_3_2_b=If the session authority successfully terminates the principal's session with \
  respect to itself, then it MUST respond to the original requester, if any, with a <LogoutResponse> \
  message containing a top-level status code of urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success.

SAMLCore_3_7_3_2_c=If it cannot do so, then it MUST respond with a <LogoutResponse> message \
  containing a top-level status code indicating the error. Thus, the top-level status indicates the \
  state of the logout operation only with respect to the session authority itself.

SAMLCore_3_7_3_2_d=In the event that not all session participants successfully respond to these \
  <LogoutRequest> messages (or if not all participants can be contacted), then the session \
  authority MUST include in its <LogoutResponse> message a second-level status code of \
  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:PartialLogout to indicate that not all other session \
  participants successfully responded with confirmation of the logout.

SAMLCore_3_7_3_2_e=When constructing a logout request message, the session authority MUST set the \
  value of the NotOnOrAfter attribute of the message to a time value, indicating an expiration time \
  for the message, after which the logout request may be discarded by the recipient.

SAMLCore_4_1_2_a=A SAML asserting party MUST NOT issue any assertion with an overall Major.Minor \
  assertion version number not supported by the authority.

SAMLCore_4_1_3_2_a=A SAML responder MUST NOT issue a response message with a major response version \
  number lower than the major request version number of the corresponding request message except to \
  report the error urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:RequestVersionTooHigh.

SAMLCore_4_1_3_2_b=A SAML responder MUST NOT issue a response message with a response version number\
   higher than the request version number of the corresponding request message.

SAMLCore_4_1_3_3_a=Assertions of a particular major version appear only in response messages of the \
  same major version, as permitted by the importation of the SAML assertion namespace into the SAML \
  protocol schema. For example, a V1.1 assertion MAY appear in a V1.0 response message, and a V1.0 \
  assertion in a V1.1 response message, if the appropriate assertion schema is referenced during \
  namespace importation. But a V1.0 assertion MUST NOT appear in a V2.0 response message because \
  they are of different major versions.

SAMLCore_4_2_a=The major and minor version in the URI MUST correspond to the major and minor version \
  of the specification set in which the namespace is first introduced and defined.

SAMLCore_5_4_2_a=Signatures MUST contain a single <ds:Reference> containing a same-document \
  reference to the ID attribute value of the root element of the assertion or protocol message \
  being signed. For example, if the ID attribute value is 'foo', then the URI attribute in the \
  <ds:Reference> element MUST be '#foo'.

SAMLCore_6_1_a=Encryption of the <Assertion>, <BaseID>, <NameID> and <Attribute> elements is \
  provided by use of XML Encryption [XMLEnc]. Encrypted data and [E30]zero or more encrypted keys \
  MUST replace the plaintext information in the same location within the XML instance.

SAMLCore_6_1_b=The <EncryptedData> element's Type attribute SHOULD be used and, if it is present, \
  MUST have the value http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#Element.

SAMLCore_8_1_2_a=A SAML authority MUST NOT authorize both an action and its negated form [in the \
  Namespace attribute of the <Action> element].

SAMLCore_8_2_2_a=The attribute name MUST follow the convention for URI references (see RFC 2396) \
  [when using the Uri name attribute format]

SAMLCore_8_2_3_a=The class of strings acceptable as the attribute name MUST be drawn from the set \
  of values belonging to the primitive type xs:Name [when using the Basic name attribute format]

SAMLCore_8_3_2_a=[T]he content of the element is in the form of an email address, specifically \
  "addr-spec" as defined in IETF RFC 2822 [RFC 2822] Section 3.4.1. An addr-spec has the form \
  local-part@domain. Note that an addr-spec has no phrase (such as a common name) before it, has no \
  comment (text surrounded in parentheses) after it, and is not surrounded by "<" and ">".

SAMLCore_8_3_6_a=[T]he content of the element is the identifier of an entity that provides \
  SAML-based services (such as a SAML authority, requester, or responder) or is a participant in \
  SAML profiles (such as a service provider supporting the browser SSO profile)...The \
  NameQualifier, SPNameQualifier, and SPProvidedID attributes MUST be omitted.

SAMLCore_8_3_6_b=[T]he content of the element is the identifier of an entity that provides \
  SAML-based services (such as a SAML authority, requester, or responder) or is a participant in \
  SAML profiles (such as a service provider supporting the browser SSO profile)...The syntax of \
  such an identifier is a URI of not more than 1024 characters in length.

SAMLCore_8_3_7_a=Persistent name identifier values MUST NOT exceed a length of 256 characters.

SAMLCore_8_3_7_b=The element's NameQualifier attribute, if present, MUST contain the unique \
  identifier of the identity provider that generated the identifier (see Section 8.3.6).

SAMLCore_8_3_7_c=Note that a different system entity might later issue its own protocol message or \
  assertion containing the identifier; the NameQualifier attribute does not change in this case, \
  but MUST continue to identify the entity that originally created the identifier (and MUST NOT be \
  omitted in such a case).

SAMLCore_8_3_7_d=The element's SPNameQualifier attribute, if present, MUST contain the unique \
  identifier of the service provider or affiliation of providers for whom the identifier was \
  generated (see Section 8.3.6).

SAMLCore_8_3_8_a=Transient identifier values MUST be generated in accordance with the rules for \
  SAML identifiers (see Section 1.3.4), and MUST NOT exceed a length of 256 characters.

SAMLBindings_3_4_4_1_f=To construct the signature, a string consisting of the concatenation of the \
  RelayState (if present), SigAlg, and SAMLRequest (or SAMLResponse ) query string parameters \
  (each one URL-encoded) is constructed in one of the following ways (ordered as below): \
  SAMLRequest=value&RelayState=value&SigAlg=value \
  SAMLResponse=value&RelayState=value&SigAlg=value

SAMLBindings_3_4_4_1_g=The signature value MUST be encoded using the base64 encoding \

  named Signature

SAMLBindings_3_4_6_a=[See also SAMLBindings_3_5_6]HTTP interactions during the message exchange \

  within a form as defined by [HTML401] Section 17.

SAMLBindings_3_5_4_b=If the message is a SAML request, then the form control MUST be named \
  SAMLRequest. If the message is a SAML response, then the form control MUST be named SAMLResponse.

SAMLBindings_3_5_4_c=If a "RelayState" value is to accompany the SAML protocol message, it MUST \
  be placed in an additional hidden form control named RelayState within the same form with the \
  SAML message.

SAMLBindings_3_5_4_d=The action attribute of the form MUST be the recipient's HTTP endpoint for \
