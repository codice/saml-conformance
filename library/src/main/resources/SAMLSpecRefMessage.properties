SAMLProfiles_3_1_a=One or more <ds:KeyInfo> elements MUST be present within the \
  <SubjectConfirmationData> element.

SAMLProfiles_3_1_b=An xsi:type attribute MAY be present in the <SubjectConfirmationData> element \
  and, if present, MUST be set to saml:KeyInfoConfirmationDataType (the namespace prefix is \
  arbitrary but must reference the SAML assertion namespace).

SAMLProfiles_3_1_c=Note that in accordance with [XMLSig], each <ds:KeyInfo> element MUST identify \
  a single cryptographic key. Multiple keys MAY be identified with separate <ds:KeyInfo> \
  elements, such as when different confirmation keys are needed for different relying parties.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_2=The HTTP Redirect binding MUST NOT be used, as the response will typically \
  exceed the URL length permitted by most user agents.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_1_a=If the identity provider cannot or will not satisfy the request, it \
  MUST respond with a <Response> message containing an appropriate error status code or codes.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_1_b=Note that the service provider MAY include a <Subject> element in the \
  request that names the actual identity about which it wishes to receive an assertion. This \
  element MUST NOT contain any <SubjectConfirmation> elements. If the identity provider does \
  not recognize the principal as that identity, then it MUST respond with a <Response> message \
  containing an error status and no assertions.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_a=If the <Response> message is signed or if an enclosed assertion is \
  encrypted, then the <Issuer> element MUST be present.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_b=If present [the Issuer] MUST contain the unique identifier of the issuing \
  identity provider.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_c=The Format attribute MUST be omitted or have a value of \
  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_d=[A Response] MUST contain at least one <Assertion>.

#SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2e(If multiple assertions are included, then each assertion's <Subject> element
# MUST refer to the same principal.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_g=Any assertion issued for consumption using this profile MUST contain a \
  <Subject> element with at least one <SubjectConfirmation> element containing a Method of \
  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_h=At least one bearer <SubjectConfirmation> element MUST contain a \
  <SubjectConfirmationData> element that itself MUST contain a Recipient attribute containing the \
  service provider's assertion consumer service URL and a NotOnOrAfter attribute that limits the \
  window during which the assertion can be [E52]confirmed by the relying party. It MAY also \
  contain an Address attribute limiting the client address from which the assertion can be \
  delivered. It MUST NOT contain a NotBefore attribute. If the containing message is in response \
  to an <AuthnRequest>, then the InResponseTo attribute MUST match the request's ID.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_i=The set of one or more bearer assertions MUST contain at least one \
  <AuthnStatement> that reflects the authentication of the principal to the identity provider.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_j=If the identity provider supports the Single Logout profile, defined in \
  Section 4.4, any authentication statements MUST include a SessionIndex attribute to enable \
  per-session logout requests by the service provider.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_k=Each bearer assertion MUST contain an <AudienceRestriction> including the \
  service provider's unique identifier as an <Audience>.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_2_l=If the identity provider wishes to return an error, it MUST NOT include \
  any assertions in the <Response> message.

SAMLProfiles_4_1_4_5=If the HTTP POST binding is used to deliver the <Response>, [E26]each \
  assertion MUST be protected by a digital signature. This can be accomplished by signing each \
  individual element or by <Assertion> signing the <Response> element.

SAMLCore_3_3_2_3=A single query MUST NOT contain two <saml:Attribute> elements with the same Name \
